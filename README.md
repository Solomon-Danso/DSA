# A DATE WITH DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHM 

Data structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize data 

- A real life tree can store and organize many fruit, therefore a tree is a data structure
- An array store and organise data, therefore an array is a data structure
* Data structures are not variables
 
An algorithm is a step by step procedure to solve a problem 
-Step by step procedure to prepare a food

# Stacks 
[-] it follows the LIFO procedure 
[-] The stack is just like an empty container, We push element (video games) into the container, then it piles up 
[-] To assess the bottom of the stack we need to remove the element on top of it until we reach the bottom using Pop 
[-] There are five unique methods in the stack which are: Push, Pop, Peek, isEmpty, search
[-] Further stack implementation is in the code
